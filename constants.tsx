When I first started diving into the code for this, it was just a side project born out of a lot of late nights. I remember sitting there, wondering what to call it, and I kept coming back to that long-running joke we’ve had for years. "Vidio Di Jour", the name of our old Snapchat group. It was just our stupid, funny way of saying "Video of the Day" with that heavy Moroccan accent we always used to joke around with. At first, I used the name because I thought this was just going to be a tiny, private thing for the inner circle.

But that’s the part that actually gets me a little emotional. What started as a niche tool for a few friends somehow grew. Seeing it spread from that original group to include family, and then friends of friends, has been incredible.

I spent hours obsessing over the small stuff, perfecting the metadata, cleaning up the interface, and making sure the anime and movie sections felt just right, because I wanted it to feel like something we could actually be proud to use. But the real "click" moment for me wasn't the code; it was seeing the "Active Sessions" start to fill up. Seeing one of you discover a random show on a Friday night or finally sit down to watch that one movie I’ve been recommending for months... that’s what made the work worth it.

It’s one thing to build an app, but it’s another thing to see your friends and family actually finding something they love inside of it. This year has been a massive learning curve for me, and I’m honestly so proud of how much it’s grown. It started as a blank script and a Snapchat inside joke, and turned into this shared space where we all just get to enjoy good stories.

Thank you for taking a chance on my "home-cooked" app and for making 2025 such a great first year. I’m already looking forward to tweaking things further and seeing what we all discover in 2026.
